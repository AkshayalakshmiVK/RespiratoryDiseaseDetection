InfoGAN based Respiratory Disease Detection from respiratory sounds with Deep neural network

This is a Deep-learning based bio-informatics project that focuses on detecting respiratory diseases through respiratory sounds with a deep neural network. 
Prior to feeding the audios to the model, the heart sounds are removed through independent component analysis and the sounds are fed to an information-maximising GAN to augment the data with new generated sounds. 
This model achieves a better accuracy in prediction and performs better with both training and test sets.
